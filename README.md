# CodeBuddy — Aapka Apna Offline Code Reviewer
CodeBuddy is not just another developer tool.  
It is a small attempt to make **learning programming less lonely, less intimidating, and more accessible**.

For many students — especially those from rural areas, low-resource schools, or self-learning backgrounds — coding often happens without mentors, paid platforms, or reliable internet. Mistakes feel overwhelming, and asking for help is not always easy.
CodeBuddy was built for them.

*Why CodeBuddy Exists*
I noticed that many learners struggle not because they lack ability, but because they lack **guidance at the right moment**.
- Internet is slow or unavailable  
- Paid tools are out of reach  
- Teachers or mentors are not always accessible  

CodeBuddy acts like a **patient coding buddy** who:
- looks at your code
- explains what’s wrong
- suggests how to improve
- and does so without judgment

All this happens **locally**, without depending on paid APIs or constant internet access.

## What CodeBuddy Can Do

-  Reviews your code and explains it in simple terms  
-  Points out logical mistakes and bad practices  
-  Suggests cleaner, better approaches  
-  Works with multiple programming languages  
-  Designed for low-network or offline environments  
-  Keeps your code private (runs locally)
  
## How It’s Built
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js & Express  
- **AI Engine:** Ollama (local open-source LLMs)  
- **Design Philosophy:** Simple, calm, and learner-friendly  

No flashy distractions. No unnecessary complexity.

## The Bigger Picture
CodeBuddy is meant to be an **equaliser**.
It is for:
- students who hesitate to ask questions  
- first-generation learners  
- rural schools and colleges  
- anyone learning to code with limited resources  

## Running the Project Locally:
*Prerequisites*
- Node.js installed
- Ollama installed and running

### Start Backend
```bash
cd Backend
npm install
npm run dev
```
### Start Frontend
```bash
